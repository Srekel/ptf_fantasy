            <h1>Introduction to Pocket Task Force</h1>
            <p>Pocket Task Force - PTF - is a pen-and-paper Role Playing Game with the following USPs:
                <ol>
                    <li>Everyone is the Game Master together. (See The PTF Rule below for how this works)</li>
                    <li>It's compact. The rules are no more than a few pages long. You can almost literally
                        carry it in your pocket!</li>
                    <li>Combat is deadly. Attempts to hack-and-slash your way to a mission will
                        likely lead to the death of all of your characters.</li>
                    <li>Planning is half the game. Often you'll need to do something that requires
                        a lot of forethought.</li>
                    <li>Teamwork is key. You'll likely need to cover all sorts of situations, and
                        no one character can know or do everything.</li>
                    <li>Freedom of character building. No classes, no skill trees. Build your character
                        as you'd like her to be.</li>
                    <li>Studying long tomes of lore are not needed to play the game - just jump in
                        and make it up on the spot!</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h1>What's different about Pocket Task Force: Fantasy Edition?</h1>
            <p>The setting is the obvious part. The original Pocket Task Force was set in a near-future setting where the players
                played agents working for 'evil' corporations, doing less than legal missions for them.</p>
            <p>In <span class="keyword">PTF: Fantasy Edition</span>, you play as up-and-coming adventurers, taking jobs for...
                Well, you decide! While you'll face goblins and bandits and caravans and other
                things you might expect in a fantasy world, the gameplay of PTF is unlike anything
                you've tried before. :)</p>
            <p>The most iconic part about PTF - that everyone is the Game Master, and The PTF Rule - is identical. All other
                rules are have been re-made from scratch to better suit a fantasy theme: character creation and development,
                dice rolling, combat, etc.
            </p>
            <p>There's a lot more in PTF: Fantasy. Maybe this is due to fantasy being a richer theme than near-future-sci-fi,
                or maybe it's just because we're fleshing it out. To counteract the character sheet not fitting into a single
                side of an sheet of A4, there's now a "web app" that can export something more compact.
