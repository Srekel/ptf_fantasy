        <h1>Introduction to Pocket Task Force</h1>
        <p>Pocket Task Force - PTF - is a pen-and-paper Role Playing Game with the following USPs:
            <ol>
                <li>Everyone is the Game Master together. (See The PTF Rule below for how this works)</li>
                <li>It's compact. The rules are no more than a few pages long.</li>
                <li>Combat is deadly. Attempts to hack-and-slash your way to a mission will
                    likely lead to the death of all of your characters.</li>
                <li>Planning is half the game. Often you'll need to do something that requires
                    a lot of forethought.</li>
                <li>Teamwork is key. You'll likely need to cover all sorts of situations, and
                    no one character can know or do everything.</li>
                <li>Freedom of character building. No classes, no skill trees. Build your character
                    as you'd like her to be.</li>
                <li>Studying long tomes of lore are not needed to play the game - just jump in
                    and make it up on the spot!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>The original Pocket Task Force was set in a near-future setting where the players
            played agents working for 'evil' corporations, doing less than legal missions for them.</p>
        <p>In <span class="keyword">PTF: Fantasy Edition</span>, you play as up-and-coming adventurers, taking jobs for...
            Well, you decide! While you'll face goblins and bandits and caravans and other
            things you might expect in a fantasy world, the gameplay of PTF is unlike anything
            you've tried before. :)</p>
        </p>
        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>The PTF Rule</h2>
            <p>PTF is defined more than anything by its main rule, or mechanic.
                In Pocket Task Force, everyone is the GM, or Game Master, together. To
                determine the state of the world, a character, an object, or
                to resolve what happens in a particular situation this is what
                the GMs do:
                <ol>
                    <li>Talk and figure out the various reasonable options.</li>
                    <li>Discuss their relative likelyhood/probability.</li>
                    <li>Arrange it on a scale of a die of your choosing.
                        D10 or D20 is recommended due to splitting up into
                        easy-to-understand chunks of 5 or 10 percent.</li>
                    <li>Roll the die!</li>
                </ol>
                For example:
                <ol>
                    <li>The weather could be sunny, cloudy, or rainy.</li>
                    <li>It was earlier decided that the game takes place in a desert.</li>
                    <li>So let's say 75% chance of sun, 20% cloudy, 5% rain. On a D20
                        that's 1-15 = sun, 16-19 = clouds, 20 = rain.
                    </li>
                    <li>A roll of 1 could be interpreted as it's not only sunny, but
                        scorching hot. 15 could be that there are some thin white
                        clouds forming in the sky.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                The mechanic is super simple but extremely powerful - and fun!
            </p>

            <h2>Action Tests</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rolls on actions performed by character
                    are rolled with a number of D6 (six-sided dice).</li>
                <li>Before rolling, the character may
                    <span class="keyword">Concentrate</span>: Discard
                    two or more D6 and replace them with one D8 for every pair of D6.</li>
                <li>The result of a D6 die roll counts as following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1: Critical Fail (<span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>)</li>
                        <li>2-3: Fail</li>
                        <li>4-5: Success</li>
                        <li>6: Critical Success (<span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    In other words, equal chance of succeding or failing.
                </li>
                <li>The result of a D8 die roll counts as following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-2: Fail</li>
                        <li>3-8: Success</li>
                    </ul>
                    In other words, 25% chance of Fail, 75% chance of Success.
                </li>
                <li>After rolling, the player can use one or more
                    Fate Points to affect the result. Each FP can:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reroll one die.</li>
                        <li>Add one D6 to the roll.</li>
                        <li>Turn one Success to a <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span> AND one Success to a Fail.</li>
                        <li>Increase the value of one die AND reduce another die. (?)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For each pair of <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span> and <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>, remove both.</li>
                <li>For each pair of <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span> and Success, remove both.</li>
                <li>The following happens if there are any <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>s left:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All the <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>s counts as Success. In addition, roll one D6 for each CS and follow this table:</li>
                        <li>1-3: Gain one Fate Point.</li>
                        <li>4-5: Use a Technique without drawback.</li>
                        <li>6: Take 1D8 and store it for the next Action Test.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>And this happens if there are any <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>s left.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow the result from this list, and use The PTF Rule to determine what happens.</li>
                        <li>1 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Trivial fumble. </li>
                        <li>2 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Minor fumble.</li>
                        <li>3 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Fumble.</li>
                        <li>4 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Moderate Fumble.</li>
                        <li>5 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Serious Fumble.</li>
                        <li>6+ <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Critical Fumble.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1D6 means: One six sided die.</li>
                <li>1D6 means: One eight sided die. Et cetera.</li>
                <li>AD6 means: Look at character's Agility. Roll that
                    many D6.</li>
                <li>SD6, WD6, CD6 means: Same as AD6 but look at
                    Strength, Wisdom, Charisma.</li>
                <li>AD6 * Strength for an action means:
                    Roll AD6. Count the number of successes.
                    Multiply that number with the character's Strength.</li>
                <li>AWD6 means:
                    Add your Agility and Wisdom together. Roll that many D6s.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <p>In combat, each character (player, allies, and enemies) has 2 actions per round. Each action can be used for
                either movement or an attack.
                Roll an AWD6 Action Test for each combatant at the start of the combat. Highest value goes first.</p>
            <p>When attacking, look at the Attack action of your equipped weapon. Roll the dice and calculate the total damage.
                Then subtract the enemy's armor rating from the damage. Subtract the damage from the total health. If that reaches 0,
                the enemy has died.
            </p>
            <p>A Move Action allows you to move five meters. Using two move actions in one turn takes you roughly 20 meters.</p>

            <h2>Sneaking</h2>
            <p>Combat is deadly in Pocket Task Force, so it's often a better idea to sneak past an enemy, or take them out
            without anyone else noticing. To sneak past someone, roll an WD6 * Agility Action Test. The result needs to be higher
            than the enemy's Wisdom + modifiers. These modifiers are best left up to decide on the spot, but here are some guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In field of view and in light: 3</li>
                <li>In field of view and in dark: 1</li>
                <li>Within 5 meters on noisy ground (e.g. twigs): 3</li>
                <li>Within 10 meters on soft ground (e.g. dirt): 1</li>
                <li>Per enemy: 1</li>
                <li>Enemy is on alert: 1</li>
                <li>Enemy is looking for player: 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that in some cases making sound doesn't play in, and in some cases visibility doesn't play in.
