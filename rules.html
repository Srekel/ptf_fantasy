        <h1>Introduction to Pocket Task Force</h1>
        <p>A long time ago, three friends decided they wanted something to do during breaks between classes in university. They decided that a pen-and-paper role-playing-game would be fun, but classic RPGs have two features that made them unsuitable:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They take a long time to play. [this might not necessarily be true, but we thought so at the time!] The sessions needed to be short; one to a few hours. </li>
            <li>One player needs to be the Game Master, leaving only two of us to actually play the game. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This didn't suit us, so naturally we decided to make our own game. The details of how it went down are forgotten, but as soon as we started, things fell into place pretty quickly. Since then, we've iterated on the concept and the rules many, many times. We've shown it to a lot of people (50-ish) and it's been a lot of fun seeing their reactions, watching them play the same missions we have, in completely different ways. </p>
        <p>The idea for a fantasy version came up a few years after the original PTF, but we never got very far and we put PTF on a bit of a hold. But after many years, here it is. PTF: Fantasy Edition!</p>

        <h1>What's special about Pocket Task Force?</h1>
        <p>Pocket Task Force - PTF - is a pen-and-paper Role Playing Game with the following main Unique Selling Points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Everyone are Game Masters, and everyone plays a character (*).</li>
            <li>It's compact. The rules are and character sheet fit on a single sheet of A4. You can literally carry it in your pocket!</li>
            <li>Combat is deadly. An upfront battle will likely lead to the death of all of your characters.</li>
            <li>Pre-written lore is minimalistic. In PTF you make it up as you go along.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(*) Stricly speaking it's not necessary for everyone to play a character. We've sometimes had groups of six or more play, and then it can be more suitable for some players to just do the Game Master role. It works really well, as you will notice when playing the game. In fact, you'll likely find that more people are willing to not play a character than to not be a GM - it's just too much fun. :)</p>

        <h1>What's different about Pocket Task Force: Fantasy Edition?</h1>
        <p>The setting is the obvious part. The original Pocket Task Force is set in a near-future setting where the players play agents working for 'evil' corporations, doing less than legal missions.</p>
        <p>In <span class="keyword">PTF: Fantasy Edition</span>, you play as up-and-coming adventurers, taking jobs for... Well, you decide! While you'll face goblins and bandits and caravans and wizards and other things you might expect in a fantasy world, the gameplay of PTF is unlike anything you've tried before. :)</p>
        <p>The most iconic part about PTF - that everyone is the Game Master, and The PTF Rule - is identical. All other rules are have been re-made from scratch to better suit a fantasy theme: character creation and development, dice rolling, combat, etc.</p>
        <p>There's a lot more in PTF: Fantasy. Maybe this is due to fantasy being a richer theme than near-future-sci-fi, or maybe it's just because we're fleshing it out. This time, we are also making an effort to properly describe The PTF Rule and how to be multiple GMs at the same time. As a result, PTF: Fantasy no longer fits on a single piece of paper. To counteract that, there's now a web app that can compact your character sheet into something even smaller than before.</p>

        <h1>How to GM together</h1>
        <p>In Pocket Task Force, everyone is the GM - Game Master - together. As you might expect, GMing works a little bit differently compared to traditional RPGs.</p>
        <p>There is no hierarchy between the GMs. There's not a "main" GM that gets to decide when the group can't agree. It's not a democracy - you don't vote on what happens. PTF is governed by three things: Common sense, consensus, and the role of the die. Lets ignore the first part a bit and jump straight to how the actual mechanic works: The PTF Rule.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>The PTF Rule</h2>
            <p>PTF is defined more than anything by its main rule, or mechanic. It is very simple, but very powerful - and fun!</p>
            <p>To determine the state of the world, a character, an object, or to resolve what happens in a particular situation, this is what the GMs do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Talk and figure out the various reasonable options.</li>
                <li>Discuss their relative likelyhood/probability.</li>
                <li>Arrange it on a scale of a die of your choosing. A D20 is recommended due to it splitting up into easy-to-understand chunks of 5 percent.</li>
                <li>Roll the die!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here's an example. You want to know what the weather is like. Maybe just for immersion, or maybe to know how hard it will be for a guard to spot you, or maybe your characters are following some tracks and one of the players suggests they may have been washed away by rain.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You decide that the weather can be sunny, cloudy, or rainy.</li>
                <li>It was earlier decided that you are currently in a desert.</li>
                <li>You figure that means it's 80% chance of sun, 15% cloudy, 5% rain. On a D20 that's 1-16 = sun, 17-19 = clouds, 20 = rain.</li>
                <li>A roll of 1 could be interpreted as it's not only sunny, but scorching hot. 16 could be that there are some thin white clouds forming in the sky.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's basically it. There are special rules for combat, magic, sneaking, talking, etc., and these may weave in The PTF Rule in various ways. You'll read about that under Player Mechanics. There are also some nuances that may not be immediately obvious, and we'll take a look at them next.</p>
            <p>Note that this is the rule in its entirety. What follows next is a bit wishy-washy, fluffy suggestions on how to make the most out of PTF. It is a rare game mechanic and it's not immediately obvious how to use it.</p>
            <h2>You can always fall back on The PTF Rule</h2>
            <p><span class="important">The PTF Rule can always be used as an alternative to any other mechanic, or as a fallback when the general rules don't apply to a particular circumstance.</span> Maybe you're trying to convince a whole room of people that the local vampire they've been harassing is, in fact, not evil at all, and that a mutual cooperation would work out great for everyone. Instead of rolling a test for every person to see how they react, you can figure out the odds for how many people believe you and how many start reaching for their pitchforks, and resolve that with a single roll.</p>
            <h2>Lookup tables and common target values</h2>
            <p>You might wonder what some standard target values for some things are when it comes to The PTF Rule. Like, what are the possible states and probabilities for a door? Well, a door can generally be open, closed and locked. But you don't need us to tell you that! It could also be magically locked, slightly ajar, unlockable only by two keys getting turned at the same time, there could be a small door for cats inside the door, and the cat-door's state doesn't have to match the regular door's state. All of these options and how to resolve the openness of the door can be found in Table 34C - Doors.</p>
            <p>Just kidding. <span class="important">There are no tables for The PTF Rule</span>. As you can tell, the options are endless, and there's only one way to find out. Talk about it. Is it the door to a king's treasury room? Does the king have a cat? Ask yourself as many questions as possible to ensure that you're not missing some important detail. Then use common sense and decide what the probabilities of the options are - we like to think of it in terms of percentage - then map it to a D20, and roll the die!
            <h2>How not to use The PTF Rule</h2>
            <p>PTF gives the players a lot of power. It is easy to abuse it, and to use it in the wrong way. Obviously, players are allowed to play PTF however they want, and we encourage you to play it in the way suit your preferences and play styles the best. What follows are recommendations for how we feel is the best way to get the most out of the game, based on how we have played the game and on how others have played it.</p>
            <h3>Making the game too easy</h3>
            <p>You might be asking: But if the players are all game masters, they can just decide that all enemies are hit by lightning and that doors are unlocked and that chests are filled to the brim with... right?</p>
            <p>Technically, yes. PTF does require a degree of self control in the players. But so do all co-op games. You could easily just remove half of the diseases in the board game Pandemic, but it wouldn't be much fun. Or, you know, maybe you do like playing that way, and that's fine too. Just know that the designers of the game came up with a ruleset in which they tried to maximize the fun, so you should probably try and keep to the rules unless you have good reason to break them.</p>
            <h3>Making the game too simple</h3>
            <p>Here's something we've noticed in some players that don't <span class="highlight">get</span> PTF.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                Ok, so I'm standing by a door. I'm going to try to open it.<br/>
                Wait, we should check if it's locked or unlocked to see if you can do that.<br/>
                Sure. Well it's fifty-fifty I guess?<br/>
                *Rolls D20*<br/>
                15. It's unlocked.<br/>
            </div>
            <p>If you play PTF like this, you're gonna have a bad time. We've watched players go into detail about the shape and angle of a roof and what type of roof tiles it has and how old the house was, just to be able to decide if they could skyglide to it and land safely from a nearby mountain. They had a much better time. You need to figure out where your preferred level of detail lies, but we promise that more detail and higher fidelity will almost always lead to more interesting choices and a more immersive experience.</p>
            <h3>Making the game too actiony</h3>
            <p>For a couple of missions, during the development of PTF, we thought it sounded fun to make it feel more like an action movie. People doing somersaults and throwing themselves through windows, guards being oblivios and stupid, etc.</p>
            <p>That sounds pretty good, and if you can make it work for you - by all means, go ahead. But for us, it didn't work so well. Here's why: It is hard to do it without falling for the "making PTF too easy" trap. If you are playing the action heroes, and you're facing the villains, then it's all but predetermined that you will complete the mission without any substantial problems. If you can always justify something that is towards your advantage with the argument that "That's what would happen in an action movie!", then you are going to do that. The problem then becomes that all tension is lost, and tension is one of greatest thing you can feel when playing a game like PTF.</p>
            <h2>How to actually use The PTF Rule</h2>
            <p>When PTF is at it's best, you will feel like your group is on the brink of failure, stuck in a bad situation you put yourself in, possibly facing death for all your characters, despite being all-knowing, powerful GMs. How is that possible? How do you create such situations, full of tension?</p>
            <h3>Use common sense</h3>
            <p>When deciding upon the options and their chances for The PTF Rule, approach it from a direction of common sense, realism, and believabilty. If you do this, you will not feel like you cheated your way to a win. Did the guard forget to look around, then choose to turn left instead of right, thereby missing you hiding in the darkness? Well, you came up with reasonable percentages and rolled the die, and it came up in your favor. Totally fair! Had you instead tried to make up an excuse for why she would just turn around.




            </p>

            <h2>Secrets</h2>
            <p>Here's probably the trickiest subject with the whole everyone's the GM thing: How do you manage things that are secret to the players' characters? Secret codes, NPC out-of-sight actions, PCs fumbling and believing they managed to trick the guard but she's going to ring the alarm as soon as the player leaves, etc. There are a few options here, but we'll wait with talking about them until a later chapter on advanced PTFing!</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Character creation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick a race.</li>
                <li>Pick two weapons.</li>
                <li>Pick an armor.</li>
                <li>Pick two perks.</li>
                <li>Pick one technique.</li>
                <li>Roll a D6 - the result is your Luck.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Character development</h2>
            <p>After a completed session, you gain a level.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick one perks.</li>
                <li>Pick one technique.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Action Tests</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rolls on actions performed by character
                    are rolled with a number of D6 (six-sided dice).</li>
                <li>Before rolling, the character may
                    <span class="keyword">Concentrate</span>: Discard
                    two or more D6 and replace them with one D8 for every pair of D6.</li>
                <li>The result of a D6 die roll counts as following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1: Critical Fail (<span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>)</li>
                        <li>2-3: Fail</li>
                        <li>4-5: Success</li>
                        <li>6: Critical Success (<span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    In other words, equal chance of succeding or failing.
                </li>
                <li>The result of a D8 die roll counts as following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-2: Fail</li>
                        <li>3-8: Success</li>
                    </ul>
                    In other words, 25% chance of Fail, 75% chance of Success.
                </li>
                <li>After rolling, the player can use one or more
                    Fate Points to affect the result. Each FP can:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reroll one die.</li>
                        <li>Add one D6 to the roll.</li>
                        <li>Turn one Success to a <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span> AND one Success to a Fail.</li>
                        <li>Increase the value of one die AND reduce another die. (?)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For each pair of <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span> and <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>, remove both.</li>
                <li>For each pair of <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span> and Success, remove both.</li>
                <li>The following happens if there are any <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>s left:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All the <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>s counts as Success. In addition, roll one D6 for each CS and follow this table:</li>
                        <li>1-2: Gain one Fate Point.</li>
                        <li>3-4: Count an additional Success.</li>
                        <li>5: Use a Technique without drawback.</li>
                        <li>6: Take 1D8 and store it for the character's next Action Test.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>And this happens if there are any <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>s left.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow the result from this list, and use The PTF Rule to determine what happens.</li>
                        <li>1 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Trivial fumble. </li>
                        <li>2 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Minor fumble.</li>
                        <li>3 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Fumble.</li>
                        <li>4 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Moderate Fumble.</li>
                        <li>5 <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Serious Fumble.</li>
                        <li>6+ <span class="keyword_cf">CF</span>: Critical Fumble.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Working together</h3>
            <p>If two or more characters are trying to do the same thing, such as climb up some cliffs, they can help each other out. Any player who gets a <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span> can choose to give an extra D8 to a friend, instead of rolling on the <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span> table. This represents a skilled climber telling her partner where to grab and where to put the feet.</p>
            <p>If two or more characters are working together to achieve a goal, such as pushing a big rock, they both roll dice, then count all the results as if it was one big dice pool. Round up the number of remaining <span class="keyword_cs">CS</span>s to be a multiple of the number of characters.</p>

            <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1D6 means: One six sided die.</li>
                <li>1D6 means: One eight sided die. Et cetera.</li>
                <li>AD6 means: Look at character's Agility. Roll that
                    many D6.</li>
                <li>SD6, WD6, CD6 means: Same as AD6 but look at
                    Strength, Wisdom, Charisma.</li>
                <li>AD6 * Strength for an action means:
                    Roll AD6. Count the number of successes.
                    Multiply that number with the character's Strength.</li>
                <li>AWD6 means:
                    Add your Agility and Wisdom together. Roll that many D6s.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <p>In combat, each character (player, allies, and enemies) has 2 actions per round. Each action can be used for either movement or an attack. Initiators get one extra action first round if they surprise the enemy.</p>
            <p>To determine who goes first, roll an AWD6 Action Test for each combatant at the start of the combat. Highest value goes first.</p>
            <p>When attacking, look at the Attack action of the character's equipped weapon. Roll the dice and calculate the total damage. Then subtract the enemy's armor rating from the damage. Subtract the damage from the total health. If that reaches 0, the enemy has died.</p>
            <p>A Move Action allows you to move five meters. Using two move actions in one turn takes you roughly 20 meters.</p>
            <p>When a character has less than half health left, she gets -1D6 on all rolls.</p>

            <h2>Sneaking</h2>
            <p>Combat is deadly in Pocket Task Force, so it's often a better idea to sneak past an enemy, or take them out without anyone else noticing. To sneak past someone, roll an AWD6 Action Test. The result needs to be higher than the enemy's Wisdom + modifiers. These modifiers are best left up to decide on the spot, but here are some guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In field of view and in light: 3</li>
                <li>In field of view and in dark: 0</li>
                <li>Within 5 meters on noisy ground (e.g. dry twigs): 3</li>
                <li>Within 10 meters on soft ground (e.g. dirt): 0</li>
                <li>Per enemy: 1</li>
                <li>Enemy is on alert: 1</li>
                <li>Enemy is looking for player: 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that in some cases making sound doesn't play in, and in some cases visibility doesn't play in.

            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <p>A Technique is a way to amplify an action. Think of how Legolas jumps, stabs, and shoots in a continous motion.</p>
            <p>Techniques can be combined, chained, and stacked. For example, if you have the chops for it, you could attack someone with two instances of The Piercer, then do a The Follow-up, and finish it off with The Chain Reaction, moving to a new enemy.</p>
            <p>Technique costs are cumulative, so in the example above, the initial piercing attack would be made with -2D6, and the follow-up chain reaction attack -4D6.</p>

            <h2>Conversations with NPCs</h2>
            <p>When talking to an NPC in an RPG, it's common to want to convince them of something. Perhaps to let you through the gate they're guarding, to sell you something for cheap, or that these aren't the droids she's looking for. </p>
            <p>In PTF, a conversation is played out in a similar manner to combat. In combat, you use Techniques to stab, jump, kick, disarm in a smooth motion. In dialog, you spin the words by lying, bluffing, and flirting, to extract information, manipulate people to do things, or to convince them you should totally be allowed to pass.</p>
            <p>When you use a Conversation Technique, you need to specify how you want to use it. For example, when using Lie, what is it you want the opponent to falsely believe. Do an action test to see how successful you were. Then use The PTF Rule to decide the result. A successful lie generally just means the NPC believes what you told her. An unsuccessful flirt could mean she sees through you which could mean anything from calling the guards to you having a negative modifier on future conversation rolls.</p>
            <p>Naturally, nothing stops you from using multiple Conversation Techniques. The result of each one will affect the NPC and how your future attempts go.</p>
